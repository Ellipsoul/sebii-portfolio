## Social Links Site for Sebii ðŸ“­

- A very simple website displaying social links that can be opened directly within the site
- Since I didn't have as cool of a portfolio as my friend Sebii yet, I decided to make him a social links website, rather than one for myself
- I would link you to some of his work, but this site already does that ðŸ˜‡
